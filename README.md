# Apocalypse Weather App

A post-apocalyptic themed weather application that fetches real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API — and translates it into dystopian weather conditions. Built as a learning project to demonstrate HTML, JavaScript, API integration, and basic version control.

## Features

* Real-time weather data, reinterpreted with custom naming for post-apocalyptic weather hazards.

* City search using OpenWeather’s Geocoding API.

* Dynamic survival tips and scrolling ticker alerts.

* Responsive UI with retro-futuristic font and styling.

## Setup

Clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/CharlieCavill1/apocalypse-weather-app.git```

Create a `config.js` file in the root:

```const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";```

Or use the provided `config.example.js` as a starting point.

Open `index.html` in your browser using Live Server or any local server setup.

## Note on API Key Security

This project originally had an exposed API key, which is now revoked. The key is now stored locally via an ignored `config.js`. No sensitive information is committed.

## Why This Exists

This app was built as a learning project as part of web development self-study. As a portfolio element, this version shows practical understanding of:

* Front-end coding structure

* Working with APIs

* GitHub repo management

* Communicating technical decisions clearly

* Markdown
